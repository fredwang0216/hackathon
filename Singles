Singles
Understand the eligibility conditions, types of flats and CPF housing grants you may apply for if you are single, widowed or divorced, aged 35 and above, and are buying a flat on your own.

Apply for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter via the HDB Flat Portal for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amount of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for.

If you are aged 55 and above and are looking to buy a short-lease 2-room Flexi flat, or aged 65 and above and are looking to buy a Community Care Apartment (CCA), please refer to the section on seniors.

If you intend to buy a new flat (3-room or bigger) or a resale flat with CPF Housing Grant (Families) with your parents, please refer to married couples and/ or parent(s) with child(ren).

If the information below does not apply to you (e.g. you are an unwed parent and would like to buy a flat with your child(ren)), please share your situation with us via our e-Feedback form. We will assess your request holistically.
